ILFoundation adds UTF8 and hex string encoding to NSString, 
adds [RFC 2397](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2397) `data:` URL support to NSURL,
and adds `ILHashable` and `ILHashingInputStream` for calculating hashs on Data and Streams

ILFoundation supports the [CardView](https://github.com/iStumblerLabs/CardView) and 
[Soup](https://github.com/iStumblerLabs/Soup) frameworks.
